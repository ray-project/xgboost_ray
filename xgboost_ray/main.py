    This function will connect to a Ray cluster, create ``num_actors``
    remote actors, send data shards to them, and have them train an
    XGBoost classifier. The XGBoost parameters will be shared and combined
    via Rabit's all-reduce protocol.

    If running inside a Ray Tune session, this function will automatically
    handle results to tune for hyperparameter search.

    Failure handling:

    XGBoost on Ray supports automatic failure handling that can be configured
    with the :class:`ray_params <RayParams>` argument. If an actor or local
    training task dies, the Ray actor is marked as dead, and there are
    three options on how to proceed.

    First, if ``ray_params.elastic_training`` is ``True`` and
    the number of dead actors is below ``ray_params.max_failed_actors``,
    training will continue right away with fewer actors. No data will be
    loaded again and the latest available checkpoint will be used.

    Second, if ``ray_params.elastic_training`` is ``False`` and
    the number of restarts is below ``ray_params.max_actor_restarts``,
    Ray will try to schedule the dead actor again, load the data shard
    on this actor, and then continue training from the latest checkpoint.

    Third, if none of the above is the case, training is aborted.

    Args:
        params (Dict): parameter dict passed to ``xgboost.train()``
        dtrain (RayDMatrix): Data object containing the training data.
        evals (Union[List[Tuple], Tuple]): ``evals`` tuple passed to
            ``xgboost.train()``.
        evals_result (Optional[Dict]): Dict to store evaluation results in.
        additional_results (Optional[Dict]): Dict to store additional results.
        ray_params (Union[None, RayParams, Dict]): Parameters to configure
            Ray-specific behavior. See :class:`RayParams` for a list of valid
            configuration parameters.
        **kwargs: Keyword arguments will be passed to the local
            `xgb.train()` calls.

    This function will connect to a Ray cluster, create ``num_actors``
    remote actors, send data shards to them, and have them predict labels
    using an XGBoost booster model. The results are then combined and
    returned.

    Args:
        model (xgb.Booster): Booster object to call for prediction.
        data (RayDMatrix): Data object containing the prediction data.
        ray_params (Union[None, RayParams, Dict]): Parameters to configure
            Ray-specific behavior. See :class:`RayParams` for a list of valid
            configuration parameters.
        **kwargs: Keyword arguments will be passed to the local
            `xgb.predict()` calls.
